# Fetal Health Status Prediction and Analysis

## Objectives
- To handle imbalanced dataset using different resampling techniques
- To predict the fetus health status based on the CTGs reading by developing machine learning classification models using different Decision Tree algorithms
- To evaluate the performance of machine learning classification models built using different Decision Tree algorithms
