# Fetal Health Status Prediction and Analysis

## Work Summary
In this era with advanced healthcare and healthcare facilities, most pregnancies would be able to go on without incident. However, there is an approximate of 8% pregnancies involving complications that could possibly cause harms to the mother or baby (4 Common Pregnancy Complications, n.d.). Hence, regular medical checkups and prenatal tests are very crucial throughout the nine-month pregnancy to ensure the fetus grows and develops healthily, at the same time detect any problems as early as possible as a means for early preparation or treatment towards the problems that may arises to the mother or baby (Fetal Health and Development, n.d.). One of the ways to perform medical checkup and prenatal test on pregnant women is cardiotocography (CTG) which measures the fetus’s heart rate and monitors the uterus contractions. With the help of medical experts to analyze the different readings such as baseline value, accelerations, fetal movement, etc. generated from the CTG on the fetus’s heart rate and uterus contractions, the fetus’s health status on whether they are normal, pathologic, or suspect can be determined.

## Objectives
- To handle imbalanced dataset using different resampling techniques
- To predict the fetus health status based on the CTGs reading by developing machine learning classification models using different Decision Tree algorithms
- To evaluate the performance of machine learning classification models built using different Decision Tree algorithms
